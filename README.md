# MATH-CSCI485_Katherine_Luce

This project uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) in conjunction with linear regression to determine the most important features of the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn. 

To use my code, run it in jupyter notebook. 

You can change the dataset, the significant threshold of R^2 improvement to identify the optimal number of features for your model, and the number of features your datset uses.
